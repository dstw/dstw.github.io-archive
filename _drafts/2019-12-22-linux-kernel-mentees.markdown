### Overview

The Linux Kernel Mentorship Program offers a structured remote learning
opportunity to aspiring Linux Kernel developers. Experienced Linux Kernel
developers and maintainers mentor volunteer mentees and help them become
contributors to the Linux Kernel. 

The Linux Kernel Mentorship Program includes three 12-week, full-time volunteer
mentee positions, and two 24-week part-time volunteer mentee positions each
year. Please check the Summer 2020 Linux Kernel Mentorship Program and get
started. This is a remote opportunity and there is no need to relocate or move
to participate.

The program serves as a vehicle to reach out to students and developers to
inject new talent into the Linux Kernel community. It aims to increase diversity
in the Linux Kernel community and work towards making the kernel more secure and
sustainable.

The mentors are experienced developers and maintainers seeking additional help
on the project as well as an opportunity to teach aspiring developers. Many
mentors and mentees will be  focused on improving security and stability of the
kernel.

Mentees will be invited to speak at Open Source Summits to share the work they
have done during the program and will be given an opportunity to network with
the community and prospective employers. Mentees are encouraged to write blogs
to share their experience and their project, and the blogs will be published on
the Linux Foundation blog site.
