##### Who are you, and what do you do?

I am Didik Setiawan. I am aspiring Linux kernel developer working as independent
researcher. I also work as system administrator from one of trading company in
my country.  
I have a dream one day I could be a full time Linux kernel developer. I also
hope I can build local community and share with them about developing one of
most interesting open source project ever existed.

##### What hardware do you use?

My laptop is Lenovo Thinkpad. I also got loaned a HP laptop from my employer. I
maintain some server both on premise and co-location on data center. Most of
them are Intel based hardware.  
For mobile device, I have a Asus Zenpad 7.0 to help me do my daily tasks.

##### And what software?

Both of my laptop use Linux. Most of server I maintain also use Linux. I use
Ubuntu Long Term Support both Desktop and Server edition. My consideration for
using this distro is because reliability, simplicity and comes with good
community support.

##### What would be your dream setup?

On the hardware side, I have a dream to switch my laptop by upgrade my Lenovo
Thinkpad. I though that T480 series will be a good one. I also heard that Purism
has Librem laptop which is perfect for freedom and privacy concerned user.  
On mobile device, I would like to have whatever brand which support LineageOS.
But, due to popularity and approachability, I thought a Xiaomi device is a good
one. Beside that, Purism in the 2019, will plan to produce the first security
and privacy phone, Librem 5, that I thought very nice to have.  
I also would like to try open source software for networking device, such as
OpenWRT.

##### Why you create this blog?

I love to make documentation about journey of my life as a Free Software user
also as developer. By create this blog, I could share my views, ideas and
experiences to other who interested. Finally, I hope that it will be useful for
others. I licensed the contents of my blog under a
