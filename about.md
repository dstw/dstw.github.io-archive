Hi, my name is Didik Setiawan. A typical person who like to see and learn how
computer works. I love to use free and open source software. I recommend to use
free and open source software in daily life also.  
My daily activities are as a student and a software engineer. A curious student
about computer operating systems. As a software engineer, I love to giving back
contribution to the free and open source software community. I am proud
become part of them.  
This blog is my notes about programming, system administration and other
computer stuff. I make this blog to share my views and ideas to the world.
