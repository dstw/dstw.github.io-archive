##### Who are you, and what do you do?

My name is Didik Setiawan. I am a software engineer who likes to contribute to
free and open-source software. I also work as a devops engineer on an IT
company in my country.

##### What hardware do you use?

My laptop is Lenovo Thinkpad. I also got loaned a MacBook from my employer. I
maintain some server on cloud service, so I can get rid of hardware maintenance
of production server related to my work. For mobile device, I have a Xiaomi
Redmi 3 to help me do my daily tasks.

##### And what software?

Both of my laptop use Linux. Most of server I maintain also use Linux. I use
Ubuntu Long Term Support both Desktop and Server edition. My consideration for
using this distro is because reliability, simplicity and comes with good
community support.

##### What would be your dream setup?

On the hardware side, I have a dream to switch my laptop by upgrade my Lenovo
Thinkpad. I thought that T series will be a good one. I also heard that Purism
has Librem laptop which is perfect for freedom and privacy concerned users.  On
the mobile device, I would like to have whatever brand which supports LineageOS.
But, due to popularity and approachability, I thought a Xiaomi brand is a good
one.  
For home use, it is nice to have a Raspberry Pi running as a multimedia device.
I also would like to try open source software for networking device, such as
OpenWRT.

##### Why you create this blog?

I love to make documentation about journey of my life as a free and open source
software user also as developer. By create this blog, I could share my views,
ideas and experiences to other who interested. Finally, I hope that it will be
useful for others. I licensed the contents of my blog under a
